\item According to the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis, females prefer males with the most elaborate ornaments because those ornaments signal parasite resistance. Which of the following is NOT an assumption of this hypothesis?
\begin{enumerate}

\item A plant produces flowers that are open through the day and the night. An experimenter places pollen on the stigmas of freshly opened flowers and covers them after pollination to prevent natural pollinators from having access to the flowers. When experimental pollination was carried out during the day, $40$\% of the flowers yielded fruit. When experimental pollination was carried out during the night, $80$\% of the flowers yielded fruit. However, when flowers were kept open to natural pollination during the day (covered at night), $35$\% of flowers produced fruit. $20$\% of flowers exposed to natural pollination during the night (covered during the day) produced fruit. Which of the following statements is NOT a plausible explanation of these results?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item night pollinators are low in abundance
    \item night pollinators are abundant
    \item night pollinators are low in pollination efficiency
    \item pollinators are active during the day

\item Sex is determined by temperature in many reptiles, including crocodiles and turtles. While lower temperatures produce males in turtles, the pattern is the opposite in crocodiles. Due to climate change, there is an increase in temperatures which results in a change in sex ratios. In small populations, this change in demography is likely to negatively impact the population growth of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item crocodiles more than turtles
    \item neither of the two species
    \item both species equally
    \item turtles more than crocodiles
